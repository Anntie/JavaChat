JavaChat
========

### Simple Client-Server chat, written on Java

This chat is Server/Client application, therefore there are two files in this repository: Server.jar and Client.jar

### Setting up a server

To launch a server, simply type this in your terminal:

```
$ cd /Path/To/Srerver/File
$ java -jar Server.jar <port>
```

### Connecting to server with client

To connect to a server just type this:

```
$ cd /Path/To/Client/File
$ java -jar client.jar <ip> <port> <login>
```

It connects to server with login, that you like to use.
